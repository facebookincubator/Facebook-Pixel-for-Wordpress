Grow your business with Meta for WordPress!

== Description ==
This plugin will install a Meta Pixel for your page so you can capture the actions people take when they interact with your page, such as Lead, ViewContent, AddToCart, InitiateCheckout and Purchase events. It also includes support for the Conversions API.

Youâ€™ll be able to see when customers took an action after seeing your ad on Facebook and Instagram, which can help you with retargeting. And when you use the Conversions API alongside the Pixel, it creates a more reliable connection that helps the delivery system decrease your costs.

The Conversions API is designed to create a direct connection between your marketing data and the Meta systems, which help optimise ad targeting, decrease cost per action and measure results across Meta technologies.
